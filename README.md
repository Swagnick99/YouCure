**YouCure will predict diseases based on your symptoms and will give descriptions so that you get healed fast**

The **Goal** of the project is to create a platform to know your symptoms and inform you about your disease, so that
you can appoint a doctor with proper specialization, and it will also help you find your nearby hospitals.

This app is made using Flask and so you can use it in both mobile and pc.

**So let's help each other.**
